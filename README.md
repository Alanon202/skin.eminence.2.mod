IMPORTANT SETUP TIPS / FAQ: 

1. For now changing the main meny type hard-crashes Leia! You have to change it inside settings.xml!

2. Marcelveldt's BETA Repo is required for most of the skin dependencies. If you install it, the most necessary things for the skin to work should install automatically. If you encounter any errors, please try to download the dependencies manually, install them as zips, and then re-install the skin.

3. If you are backing up or restoring your skin settings, beware of two things - first, the location of your backups (see the Skin Helper Backup add-on settings), and second - properly restoring your header, widget bevel and other settings that need to be defined. For example: If you can't see the widget discs after a restore, that means you must re-set the bevel setting (literally just set it again) .

4. If you have issues regarding the settings, especially newly added ones, it's recommended to go to userdata/addon_data/skin.eminence.2.mod.Krypton and remove the settings.xml. This will remove the skins settings, allowing you to refresh them. Depending on the location, you can also use the skins own reset settings button, or manually add or delete the entry in settings.xml.

5. For the Weather widget to work, you must install the multi fanart artwork. For the moment it is needed for the widget to appear.

6. Special music artwork needs to be organised as follows: 
Artist/logo.png;
Artist/Album/disc.png OR Artist/Album/cdart.png;

The path you set in the skin settings is the root (pointing to the Artist folders).

7. To use the RightList DiscArt display, all your discs must be named "disc.png". There is no way going around this. The settings mentioned in point 6 only apply to the artist logos and the OSD spinning disc.

8. manfeed's lyrics will only work in the default font set, since Arial negates the purpose of the mod.

9. Black Glass and Solid Panel colour schemes currently break the SH setting dialogues, a search for a fix is ongoing. Use during this time is discouraged. To re-enable them, simply rename the .bak files located in "skin.eminence.2.mod.Krypton\colors" folder.

10. IF YOU HAVE PERFORMANCE ISSUES, (LIKE THE 100% CPU USAGE ON LINUX), DISABLE THE ALPHABET SCROLLBAR.

11. Skin settings / Background / background colour and opacity controls the fanart/extrafanart brightness and colour overlay. 

12. "Allow widget reloading" should be checked only if you experience bugs/problems with the way widgets refresh/load during normal use. This option will slow down widget loading.

13. Reading the descriptions in the lower left corner will clear up most of your queries about what a setting does. It is highly recommended to do so!

14. Ctrl + N will bring up the extended "Now Playing" menu!

15. To remove the home menu header, type in N/A as the custom text.
